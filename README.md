### Text-Preprocessing-using-parallel-computing
#### Text preprocessing is a method to clean the text data and make it ready to feed data to the model. Text data contains noise in various forms like emotions, punctuation, text in a different case.When it comes to human language, we have different words with the same definition which is a problem because machines can't understand them so we use text preprocessing to convert human language to machine readable format.
#### Text preprocessing involves converting upper case letters to lowercase,removing punctuations,removing blank lines,converting numbers to words,etc.
#### Dataset used:
#### The dataset is called “20 Newsgroups” and it's a collection of 18,000 newsgroup documents from 20 different newsgroups. sklearn provides a method to download and load the dataset.
#### Each message in the bundled file begins with these four headers:
#### Newsgroup,Document_id,From,Subject. Duplicate messages have been
#### removed and the original messages only contain "From" and "Subject" headers.
#### An example of the data is shown below.
