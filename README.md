### Text-Preprocessing-using-parallel-computing
#### Text preprocessing is a method to clean the text data and make it ready to feed data to the model. Text data contains noise in various forms like emotions, punctuation, text in a different case.When it comes to human language, we have different words with the same definition which is a problem because machines can't understand them so we use text preprocessing to convert human language to machine readable format.
#### Text preprocessing involves converting upper case letters to lowercase,removing punctuations,removing blank lines,converting numbers to words,etc.
